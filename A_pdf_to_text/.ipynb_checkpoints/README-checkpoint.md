# PDF to text

This directory contains all of the scripts and information necessary to download a PDF from one of Code for Africa's databases, call Read API on that PDF, and translate Read API's output into raw text. An example of this process is illustrated in walkthough_notebook.ipynb. 

Code is split through several files, each of which has a more detailed description below:

* _Thea add some stuff_

* **orderingText.ipynb:** Turns json output of Read API into raw text.

* **walkthrough_notebook.ipynb (or .html):** walks the user through the code in this directory which forms a sub-section of our overall pipeline. Includes intermediate outputs for the sake of clarity.
