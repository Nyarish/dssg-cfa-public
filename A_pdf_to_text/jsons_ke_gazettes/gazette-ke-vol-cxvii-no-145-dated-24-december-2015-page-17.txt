(c) Lack of public awareness on the role of citizens in governance and therefore low citizen participation in development; 
(d) Inadequate knowledge on the constitutional provisions on devolution and other relevant legislations among public officers; 
(e) Inadequate budgetary allocation to enhance the promotion of values and principles; 
(f) Officers from outside the county requesting for inter-county transfers and declining positions in Kitui owing to the vastness of the county, Semi-arid climate, insecurity, the difficult terrain thus defeating efforts towards patriotism and national unity. 
(g) Persons with Disability and other special groups not applying for positions in the County while those that apply fail to indicate this status. 
CHAPTER FOUR: 
PLANNED PROGRAMS IN UNDERTAKING PROMOTION OF VALUES AND PRINCIPLES 
1. Develop, produce and distribute IEC Material on Values and Principles in Kitui County. 
2. Continue Sensitising public service on Values & Principles. 3. Monitor compliance with the values & principles. 
4. Advise the County Government on its obligations under 
international treaties and conventions on need basis. 
5. Finalise the staffing of the devolved offices. 
CHAPTER FIVE: 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Board recommends the following: 
(a) Provision to the Board of adequate budgetary allocation to carry out activities that enhance promotion of Values and Principles, as well as compliance monitoring. 
(b) Partnering with the County Assembly for public awareness creation on the role of citizens in governance and the need for full participation in development agenda and activities and employment creation. 
(c) Facilitation in creation of an enabling environment for the exploitation of natural resources to create jobs for Kitui County residents. 
CONCLUSION 
The County Public Service registered substantial levels of compliance with the Values and Principles referred to in Articles 10 and 232 of the Constitution of Kenya 2010. However, so much still needs to be done to increase the compliance levels. The Board would wish that facilitation, financial and otherwise, be made available to drive the agenda on high compliance levels with values and principles. The Board appreciates the cooperation accorded by the H.E. the Governor, the County Secretary, Chief Officers and Sub County Administrators during evaluation of the extent to which values and principles have been complied with in Kitui County Public Service. 
Further, the Board appreciates the Members of the Kitui County Assembly for the oversight role and the advice given from time to time on ensuring compliance with the values and principles.
