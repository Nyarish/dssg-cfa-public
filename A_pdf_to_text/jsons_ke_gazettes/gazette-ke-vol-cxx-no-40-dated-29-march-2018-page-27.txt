NYATIKE SUB-COUNTY OF MIGORI COUNTY 
Pursuant to regulation 21 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has received an Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report for the above proposed project. 
The proponent, Peggy General Enterprises Limited, is proposing to establish a gold elution and leaching plant on land parcel measuring 2.4 hectares located within a sparsely populated neighborhood and it’s located on Plot L.R. No. Muhuru Kadem/Macalder/742, Nyatike Sub- County, Migori County. This project involves establishment of processing plant, collection of disposed tailing from artisanal miners and processing them to extract gold from it. 
The following are the anticipated impacts and proposed mitigation measures: 
Impacts Proposed Mitigation Measures

• Inform neighbours of any abnormal sound and response measures. 
• Compliance with noise and excessive vibration regulation. 
• No discretionary use of noisy machineries. • No construction work at night. 
• Adherence to Noise and Excessive Vibration Pollution (Control) Regulations, 2009. 
Air pollution and • Provision of PPE`s which must be worn.
