Foreword 
The development of a National Land Information Management System (NLIMS) requires concerted effort and collaboration amongst the various partners involved in land administration and management in Kenya. The National Land Policy (NLP) provides the impetus towards the successful implementation of NLIMS by recognition of the need for the development of standards and guidelines with respect to pricing of land information, data sharing and system integration. This NLP prescription is a recommendation to govemment to put in place the standards and guidelines to govem pricing and sharing of land information and system integration.
