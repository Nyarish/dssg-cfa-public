2.2.3 Good Governance, Integrity, Transparency and Accountability 2.2.3.1 Situation Analysis 
The County Ministries had developed organisational structures at the beginning of the year; however, they had not developed service 
charters. There were also no effective mechanisms for monitoring 
integrity, transparency and accountability. 
2.2.3.2 Action Taken 
The Board and all County ministries have, with the assistance of a consultant drawn organisational structure to streamline the processes for making and implementing decisions. Additionally, performance contracts were developed and signed by Senior County public service officers to ensure accountability. The Board has already developed its strategic plan and service charter. Most ministries are also in the process of developing service charters. Further, suggestion boxes were procured and placed in strategic places for purposes of reporting issues on integrity in the administrative acts of officers, as well as providing feedback on service delivery. 
In order to enhance transparency and accountability, the County Government published and distributed booklets highlighting all the development projects undertaken in each of the forty wards, including the cost of each project. 
2.2.4 Sustainable Development 
2.2.4.1 Situation analysis 
Kitui County Integrated Development plan (KCIDP) had been developed highlighting development needs of the County. The development projects contained in this document had been evaluated and considered based on their sustainability. Based on the above, the projects initiated are viable and sustainable. Since KCIDP is a medium term plan, there was need to develop a long-term vision for the County. 
2.2.4.1 Action taken 
The County Continues to implement projects in compliance with the KCIDP. 
The County through public participation designed a ten year economic blueprint named Kitui Vision for Economic and Social Transformation (KIVEST) fashioned on the National Vision 2030. The main objective of KIVEST is to provide a long term planning framework to guide socio-economic, political and environmental development in Kitui County. 
The County Government trained local artisans and local entrepreneurs to empower them to participate in implementation of development projects. Further, the local communities are involved in development projects through Ward Development Committees to ensure prioritization, ownership and management of those projects for sustainability purposes. All projects undertaken had been budgeted for and assessed to be financially feasible.

values are upheld. These include: 
(a) Apathy in appreciation of ICT among the County employees which makes most employees unable to access the documents uploaded in the County Website as well as using modern technology for research and communication; 
(b) Kitui County has low internet connectivity, making the offices especially those working outside the County Headquarters unable to communicate and access internet;
