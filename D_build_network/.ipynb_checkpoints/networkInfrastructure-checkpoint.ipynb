    "GLOBAL_NODES_DICT is a hashmap storing all the nodes of the graph. The keys to the hash are a name (in the case of a person or organization) or simply a unique number (in the case of a plot of land). Later work might determine a more relevant key for a plot of land to hash on. Because two individuals might share a name while being different persons with different ID numbers, the value for each key in the hash table is a list. Each item in this list contains one node object, either a personNode, orgNode, or landNode (all from networkClasses.py). \n",

    "Because values in our nodes hashtable are lists, to uniquely identify each node in our graph we must give both a hashkey (a name or unique number in this case) and a list index (almost always 0). This combination is what is later referred to in variable names as a fullKey, and uniquely identifies each node. fullKey is defined nowhere (it is really just a tuple), but it is helpful to think of as its own type of object in order to understand the code fully.\n",
