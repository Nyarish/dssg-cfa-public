Below is a description for util files used throughout our process

* **setup.ipynb:** utility function used throughout this process

* **/py_files:** .py version of notebooks in other folders.

* **reportOnTesseractText.html** A report written very early in our project on why we stopped working with Tesseract OCR available to us for free. It documents some of the many bugs in Tesseract.
