# 
# \[('PERSON', 'Dekha Sheikh'),
# 
#  ('OWNER ADDRESS', 'P.O. Box 614â€“00606, Nairobi in the Republic of Kenya'),
#  
#  ('OWNERSHIP STATUS', 'proprietor lessee'),

#  
#  ('ORG', 'Third Floor'),

#  ('LAND REGISTRATION', 'L.R. number 209/10345/9'),

#  
#  ('CARDINAL', '106703/1'),
#  
#  ('DEED STATUS', 'lost'),
#  
#  ('DATE', '60) days')\]
# 
# Each item in the outer list is an entity found within a single segment. Each inner tuple contains two items: first, the spaCy tag for the type of entity, and second, the string representing that entity. A general format is as follows:
# 
# \[TAG, string),
# 
#  (TAG, string), 
#
