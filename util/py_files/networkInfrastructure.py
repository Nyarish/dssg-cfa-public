# It will be helpful to describe the data structures in this file so that the functions below operating on them make sense.
# 
# GLOBAL_UID is simply the lowest positive int that hasn't been used as an identifier. It steadily increases as the program runs.
# 
# GLOBAL_NODES_DICT is a hashmap storing all the nodes of the graph. The keys to the hash are a name (in the case of a person or organization) or simply a unique number (in the case of a plot of land). Later work might determine a more relevant key for a plot of land to hash on. Because two individuals might share a name while being different persons with different ID numbers, the value for each key in the hash table is a list. Each item in this list contains one node object, either a personNode, orgNode, or landNode (all from networkClasses.py). 
# 
# Because values in our nodes hashtable are lists, to uniquely identify each node in our graph we must give both a hashkey (a name or unique number in this case) and a list index (almost always 0). This combination is what is later referred to in variable names as a fullKey, and uniquely identifies each node. fullKey is defined nowhere (it is really just a tuple), but it is helpful to think of as its own type of object in order to understand the code fully.
# 
# GLOBAL_EDGES_DICT is a hashmap storing all the edges in a graph. The key is simply a unique number, while the value is a four-tuple, fullKey1, fullKey2, signatorKey, edgeObj). fullKey1, fullKey2, and signatorKey are all fullKey objects, the first two to GLOBAL_NODES_DICT and the third to GLOBAL_SIGNATORS_DICT.
# 
# GLOBAL_SIGNATORS_DICT cannot have duplicate names, but for the sake of convention it keys are still names and its values are still lists, this time of signator objets from networkClasses.py. As a result, it still uses the fullKey convention when being referred to in other places.
# 
# GLOBAL_DISTRICTS_DICT contains district names as keys, and a list of fullKeys of nodes (person, org, or land) as values. It is used to create edges between nodes sharing a district.
# 
# GLOBAL_ADDRESSES_DICT contains address as keys and a list of fullKeys of nodes as values. It is used to create edges between nodes sharing an address.
# 
# When an 'owner' is reference, this refers to a personNode or an orgNode object.
