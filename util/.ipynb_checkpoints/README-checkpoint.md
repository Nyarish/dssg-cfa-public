I'm thinking we put setup.ipynb here, along with maybe some other

# Utility files

Below is a description for util files used throughout our process

* **setup.ipynb:** utility function used throughout this process

* **Kenya_districts.csv:** a table listing all of the districts in Kenya. We are away that there is some ambiguity as to the complete list of districts in Kenya and leaned towards includin more rather than fewer districts. 

* **/py_files:** .py version of notebooks in this folder.
